# 1. Introduction
## Recipe Sharing & Meal Planning Platform
We decided on a Recipe and Meal Sharing "Platform" which would allow users to create and share recipes for meals much like a social media platform where recipes can be posted, tagged, and reviewed by other users. We're looking to put in a bit of work into the UI to make it look a bit like X/Twitter, where one can scroll down a list of recipes from a user.
### Core Features:
- User authentication and profiles - we'll be looking to include these in a technical sense, but to allow for time on the rest of the project, the profiles and authentication steps will likely be the bare minimum.
- Recipe creation, editing, and sharing - The main feature of the app will focus on the recipes, listing ingredients, and posting the meal.
- Shopping list generation - As this is ingredient focused, there'll be a feature to generate a shopping list based off of the recipes you view.
- Recipe rating and reviews - Acting like our version of liking/retweeting posts, meals will be able to be rated by other users from 1-5 Stars
- Meal planning calendar - If time permits, we plan to include a calendar that one can add meals to, whether by links to a post or copying a meal to the day.


### Technical Implementation:
- UI Layer: Templates with Bootstrap for recipe browsing, meal planning calendar

- Business Logic: Recipe recommendation engine (by ratings), meal plan algorithms, shopping list optimization

- Persistence: JPA/Hibernate for recipes, users, meal plans, ratings

- External Integration: Storage for recipe images

- JSON APIs: RESTful endpoints for mobile app potential
